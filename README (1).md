# 🎓 DIU Student Data Analysis Dashboard

An interactive data visualization tool built using real-world data from **20,000+ students** of Daffodil International University (DIU). This dashboard helps uncover academic and demographic patterns, built as a part of my learning journey in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize student data in a meaningful and interactive way. Built with `Streamlit`, it provides users with the ability to dynamically filter, observe trends, and identify top-performing students based on academic metrics.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📌 **General Overview**: Summary statistics of all student data  
- 📊 **Age & CGPA Distribution**: Histograms to analyze trends  
- 🏛 **Department-wise Analysis**: Comparative visualizations of different departments  
- 🚻 **Gender-based Insights**: Understand how gender correlates with performance  
- 🏆 **Top Performers Module**: Detects the highest achievers  
- 🎯 **Performance Classification**: Categorizes students based on CGPA  
- 🔍 **Custom Filtering**: Slice and dice data using dynamic filters  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍  
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `NumPy` – Numerical processing  
- `Matplotlib` – Data visualization  
- `Streamlit` – Interactive dashboard
